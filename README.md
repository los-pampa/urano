# Thread and Boosting Frequency Throttling (TBFT)

Thread and Boosting Frequency Throttling (TBFT) is an easy to use OpenMP framework that is completely transparent to both the developer and the end-user. Without any recompilation, code modification or OS installitions, it is capable of finding, automatically and at run-time, the optimal number of threads for the parallel regions and at the same time controls the turbo boosting mode to optimize the performance and energy consumption.

### TBFT's dependencies.

1. MSR Module (only in AMD Version).
2. Intel RAPL (only in Intel Version).
3. ACPI cpu-freq driver.

**IMPORTANT: Poseidon only works with GCC 9.X version or superior.**


### How to install TBFT?
---

1. Choose the version you are going to use based on your processor (Intel or AMD).
2. Copy all files into the gcc libgomp directory:
      - cp * /path/gcc-version/libgomp.
3. Compile the GCC using Make && Make install:
      - cd /path/gcc-version/libgomp
      - make
      - make install


### How to use TBFT?
---

1. Export the library path, the full boost.sh path and set TBFT's environment variable:
      - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path-to-gcc-bin/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      - export OMP_TBFT_BOOST_PATH=/path-to-boost.sh/
      - export OMP_TBFT=TRUE
      
2. Execute the application.
